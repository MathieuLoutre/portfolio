			Our goal as a team is to create interactive spaces which will help reach new audiences. Half of it is finding an appealing “cool” concept, and the other is helping readers see the books in a different light. Oftentimes a book, particularly non fiction, can seem a little out of reach. In reality these books are made to be accessible. It’s easy to imagine someone dismissing a book because they think “it’s not for me” even before they’ve opened it. All they need is someone to shine a light so they can see the book for what it really is.

				30 years ago, Richard Dawkins wrote a suite of computer programmes to demonstrate evolution in action. We brought Dawkins’ code back to life, making them available in the browser for the first time. We then used the code to generate unique covers for each of the three books Penguin re-issued, each copy featuring a unique biomorph, shell or wave pattern.

				The challenge in converting what’s effectively a research tool into an accessible interactive game lies in abstracting what’s not necessary for the user to understand, and emphasising what’s taken for granted in the original presentation. For instance, in the original programs you could breed to infinity but being able to see the full lineage was very difficult. It was almost impossible to see the whole consequences of your breeding – how far you had come from your original creature. By using a tree, similar to phylogenetic trees, we made it possible to run multiple generations from multiple creatures at a time which clearly shows the difference in offsprings over time.

				When it came to tweaking, replacing the series of obscure numbers was crucial to make the process more accessible, and in fact more high level. Direct manipulation would have been the best approach, but given that the genes have a high interplay it was nearly impossible. So instead, we paired relevant genes together and plotted them on a surface so that you can make things in physical space rather than number space. It’s almost as if you were elongating and squishing your creature by hand.

		<div class="relative">
			<p>
				A digital narrative that brings to life Carlo Rovelli’s bestselling book Seven Brief Lessons in Physics. The book, which explains our universe and the evolution of physics in seven short, simple lessons, has a striking cover. The website uses the same visual language and crafts a unique interactive animation for each of the chapters. The resulting animations allow readers to experiment with the principles of physics in the most unusual ways, and are accompanied by audio and text extracts to explain what’s happening on screen. At the click of your mouse, particles swirl and undulate, multiply, scatter, disappear and explode, all by the hundreds.
